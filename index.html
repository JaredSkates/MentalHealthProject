    <h2 id="interesting">What is Mental Health?</h2>
    <p>
        Mental health is about our feelings, thoughts, and how we connect with others. 
        It affects how we handle stress, relate to friends, and make choices in life. 
        Sadly, many people struggle with mental health issues like anxiety and depression, which can make them feel alone and overwhelmed. 
        Because of the stigma surrounding these issues, it can be hard for them to ask for help. 
        By talking openly about mental health and supporting one another, we can create a community where everyone feels safe to seek help and take care of their well-being. 
        Remember, it’s okay to talk about how you feel!
